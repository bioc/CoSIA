# CoSIA: **C**r**o**ss **S**pecies **I**nvestigation and **A**nalysis

CoSIA is an R package that provides researchers with the tools to measure and visualize gene-expression metrics in order to compare across model organisms and their tissues. Specifically, CoSIA uses curated non-diseased wild-type RNA-sequencing expression data, from Bgee, to visualize a geneâ€™s expression across tissues and model organisms. CoSIA also streamlines conversions between gene identifiers among the same species and different species.

CoSIA is split into 5 modules that provide various resources in order for researchers to conduct cross species analysis using gene expression metrics.

The first module and second module have a shared method, getConversion, that is used to conduction conversion between different gene identifiers in the same species as well as in different species.

The third module has a method, getTissueExpression, that is used to visualize the raw gene expression values of a gene across multiple tissues in one species.

The fourth module has a method, getSpeciesExpression, that is used to visualize the raw gene expression values of

The fifth module has a method, getTranscriptomeDiversity, that is used to visualize median-based Coefficient of Variation and Shannon Entropy to look at the variation and diversity of gene expression across tissues and species.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

    Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
