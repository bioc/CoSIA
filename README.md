# CoSIA: **C**r**o**ss **S**pecies **I**nvestigation and **A**nalysis

CoSIA is an R package that provides researchers with the tools to measure and visualize gene-expression metrics in order to compare across model organisms and their tissues. Specifically, CoSIA uses curated non-diseased wild-type RNA-sequencing expression data, from Bgee, to visualize a geneâ€™s expression across tissues and model organisms. CoSIA also streamlines conversions between gene identifiers among the same species and different species.

CoSIA is split into 5 modules that provide various resources in order for researchers to conduct cross species analysis using gene expression metrics.

The first module and second module have a shared method, `getConversion`, that is used to conduction conversion between different gene identifiers in the same species as well as in different species. The third module has a method, `getTissueExpression`, that is used to visualize the raw gene expression values of a gene across multiple tissues in one model organism. The fourth module has a method, `getSpeciesExpression`, that is used to visualize the raw gene expression values of a gene in one tissues across multiple model organisms.The fifth module has a method, `getTranscriptomeDiversity`, that is used to visualize median-based Coefficient of Variation and Shannon Entropy to look at the variation and diversity of gene expression across tissues and model organisms.
